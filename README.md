I wanted to do 2d souls, but something went wrong...

**So_LONG** is a game creation project based on the minillibx library.
***
**Compilation**:

make all - compile

make re - recompile

make fclean \ clean - clean
***
**Run**:

Use "./so_long map/map.ber" to start the game.

To close the game window, use **"esq"** or the red cross in the corner of the window.

Controls on the **WSAD** keys
***
**Bonuses**:

Animations, enemies, and a motion counter have been implemented.
